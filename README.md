# Pi_GATE
Exercises forGATE Students in python on Raspberry Pi

This directory contains all of the python scripts for the exercises for the GATE lessons in python on the Raspberry Pi.
For each exercise, there is an html version of an ipython notebook that will guide the student through the lessons.  
These are located in the docs directory.  Start with TOC.html (open in your favorite browser from the docs directory

I wil also upload a raspbian image from a Pi that was used for the lesson.  You can copy this disc image and use it for your own Pi, or even
try it out on your personal computer if you have vmware or something similar.  It has the python libraries and vi settings that will
make the exercises easier to work through.
