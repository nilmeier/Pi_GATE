Exercises for GATE Students in python on Raspberry Pi

**The exercises directory:**
This directory contains all of the python scripts for the exercises for the GATE lessons in python on the Raspberry Pi.
For each exercise, there is an html version of an ipython notebook that will guide the student through the lessons.  
These are located in the docs directory.  

**Documentation:** Open exercises/docs/TOC.html for a walkthrough of the exercises.  Let me know how they look...I can update them as needed!

I have a raspbian image that I can provide you if needed, but I won't keep them on github, as they exceed the recommended file size.  These images have all of the python libraries and vi settings that will make the exercises easier to work through.  Please contact me directly and I'll happily provide this to you.
