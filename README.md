# Pi_GATE
Exercises for GATE Students in python on Raspberry Pi

**The exercises directory:**
This directory contains all of the python scripts for the exercises for the GATE lessons in python on the Raspberry Pi.
For each exercise, there is an html version of an ipython notebook that will guide the student through the lessons.  
These are located in the docs directory.  

**Documentation:** Open exercises/docs/TOC.html for a walkthrough of the exercises.  Let me know how they look...I can update them as needed!

I wil also upload a raspbian image from a Pi that was used for the lesson.  You can copy this disc image and use it for your own Pi, or even
try it out on your personal computer if you have vmware or something similar.  It has the python libraries and vi settings that will make the exercises easier to work through.
